## Object-Oriented Design (OOD) Principles

We applied core OOD concepts to ensure a clean, maintainable, and scalable design:

- **Polymorphism**: Implemented method overriding to enable context-specific behaviors while maintaining a consistent interface.
- **Inheritance**: Established hierarchical relationships between classes to promote code reuse and logical organization.
- **Abstraction**: Focused on exposing only essential features while hiding implementation details from users.
- **Encapsulation**: Protected class internals through controlled access, ensuring data integrity and security.

## Key System Components

The architecture features several interconnected classes that model the application domain:

- A central **User** class serving as the foundation for other user-related entities
- Specialized classes extending core functionality through inheritance
- Supporting classes handling specific responsibilities like payments and ratings
- Well-defined relationships between components to maintain system cohesion

## Design Improvements

Recent refinements include:

1. **Payment System Redesign**: Replaced generic payment handling with dedicated credit card management
2. **Behavior Specialization**: Enhanced trip request handling with role-specific implementations
3. **Access Control**: Strengthened data protection through careful encapsulation
